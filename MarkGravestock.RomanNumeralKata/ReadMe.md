### Roman Numeral Kata - F#

This is my attempt at the [Roman Numeral Kata](https://agilekatas.co.uk/katas/romannumerals-kata). I've done this before in C# (using Fixie as the test framework!).

I was looking at F# Katas as this is an to complete something in F#. I noticed that [Scott Wlachsin](https://swlaschin.gitbooks.io/fsharpforfunandprofit/content/posts/roman-numeral-kata.html) has a commentary
and some other material on it, so decided to give it a go before reading his notes/examples.

### Notes

- Try to use more [functional approach](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/learning-fsharp/#dos-and-donts). Use pattern matching rather than for/if-else

### Things to consider

- Triangulation
- Specific/Generic
- [TPP] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_Priority_Premise)
- Watch this http://programmingtour.blogspot.com.au/2012/12/roman-numerals-kata-with-commentary.html ?
